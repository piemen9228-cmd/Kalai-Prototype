Kalai: AI-Powered Artisan Marketplace Assistant

Project Overview
Kalai is a prototype web application designed to empower local artisans by providing them with an AI-driven marketing and sales toolkit. The platform aims to bridge the gap between traditional craftsmanship and the digital marketplace by automating key tasks that often challenge artisans, such as creating compelling content and professional product images.


How to Run the Prototype
This prototype is a single, self-contained index.html file. You can run it locally or deploy it to a static site hosting service.

Save the file: Save the code as index.html.

Open in a browser: Open the file directly in any modern web browser to interact with the prototype.

Explore the features:

Enter product details and click "Generate Content" to see the AI in action.

Click the microphone icon to simulate a multilingual voice input.

Upload an image file to see the image-handling functionality.

Note: For live functionality, a real-world implementation would require connecting to the actual Google Cloud APIs and configuring API keys, authentication, and a back-end service on Cloud Run.
