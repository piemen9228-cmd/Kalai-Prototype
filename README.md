🧵 Kalai: AI-Powered Artisan Marketplace Assistant

🌟 Project Overview
Kalai is a prototype web app built to empower local artisans by giving them an AI-driven toolkit for marketing and sales. It bridges the gap between traditional craftsmanship and the digital marketplace by automating tasks that often slow artisans down—like writing compelling product descriptions and generating professional-grade images.

🚀 How to Run the Prototype
This is a single, self-contained index.html file. You can run it locally or deploy it to any static site hosting service.

Steps to get started:

Save the file: Download or copy the code as index.html.

Open in browser: Launch it in any modern web browser.

Explore features:

Enter product details and click "Generate Content" to see AI-generated descriptions.

Click the microphone icon to simulate multilingual voice input.

Upload an image to test the image-handling functionality.

⚠️ Note: For full functionality, a production version would need integration with Google Cloud APIs, including API keys, authentication, and a backend service (e.g., Cloud Run).

⌨️ Accessibility Tips
Use Ctrl + Shift + M to toggle tab key behavior.

Alternatively, press Esc then Tab to move between interactive elements.


Note: For live functionality, a real-world implementation would require connecting to the actual Google Cloud APIs and configuring API keys, authentication, and a back-end service on Cloud Run.
